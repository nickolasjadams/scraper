# This will be the default url batch loaded into the program.

# Format should be
# "Title surrounded by quotes" https://url.goes/here
#
# This file can be simplified with a reserved keyword 'site'
# Considering that your scraping will rely on markup. 
# The urls you're gathering from should have a similar markup structure.
# So url batches should start with the same site url.
#
# Another reserved keyword will set the default element selectors
# for the data you want to collect from. That word is 'selector'
# You can use this the same way you would select with css or jquery.
# If the website you need data from has jquery loaded, you can 
# test queries in the console with `$("#selector").text()`.
