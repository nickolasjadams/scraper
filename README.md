I built this app as a weekend project as an introduction to Python's tkinter GUI toolkit. I used Beatiful Soup 4, and Webbot to make a general scraper for a friend.

py2app was used to create a stand-alone app for Mac.

To use the app you can download the Scraper.zip
Then drag the app to your Applications folder to add it in your Launchpad.

For developers that want to work with it.

*Dependencies*
 - Python3
 - bs4
 - webbot
 - py2app

See `buildapp.sh help` to see app build process.
