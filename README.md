I built this app as a weekend project as an introduction to Python's tkinter GUI toolkit. I used Beatiful Soup 4, and Webbot to make a general scraper for a friend.

py2app was used to create a stand-alone app for Mac.

To use the app you can clone this repository and double click the Scraper app in /dist.

Copy the app to your Applications folder to keep it in your Launchpad.

For developers that want to work with it.

*Dependencies*
 - Python3
 - bs4
 - webbot
 - py2app

See `buildapp.sh help` to see app build process.
